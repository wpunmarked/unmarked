## About

I’m a huge fan of Underscores, Bootstrap. Why not combine these into a solid WordPress Theme Framework?
That’s what unmarked is. 
You can use it as starter theme and build your own theme on top of it. Or you use it as parent theme and create your own child theme for unmarked.

## Starter Theme + HTML Framework = WordPress Theme Framework

The _s theme is a good starting point to develop a WordPress theme. But it is “just” a raw starter theme. That means it outputs all the WordPress stuff correctly but without any layout or design.
Why not add a well known and supported layout framework to have a solid, clean and responsive foundation? That’s where Bootstrap comes in.
